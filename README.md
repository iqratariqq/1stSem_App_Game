# 🎓 1st Semester C++ Projects

This repository contains two C++ projects developed during my **1st semester** of BS Computer Science:

1. 🎮 **Berzerk Game**
2. 🏠 **Hostel Mess Management Application**

These projects showcase my foundational skills in C++ programming, covering console game development and basic file handling applications.
